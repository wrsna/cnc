# cnc
This is a lot of files from my graduation project. At the end of high school, I wanted to make something useful for my final project so I build a CNC milling machine that I still use today.


What is not pdf or pretty pictures are vector files of metal construction created in Autodesk Inventor maybe there is a whole assembly attached
